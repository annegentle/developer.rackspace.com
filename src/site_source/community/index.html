        Rackspace is committed to supporting developers and technologists. Our developer advocates write code and documentation and build tools to make the Rackspace Cloud Platform and OpenStack easy to use. We give talks, organize conferences, teach workshops, and field questions from people around the world. We also offer sponsorships for technical events and discounted hosting for OSS projects. Let us know what kind of support you need, and a Racker will reach out to you.

        <h2>Open Source Contributions</h2>
        <p>Open source contributions are part of the job description for many Rackers. We build tools in-house and share with the community; we accept pull requests and we mentor and answer questions; and we design and implement new tools in the open. We also contribute to open source projects outside of the Rackspace and OpenStack ecosystems.    
        </p>

      
      
      
        <h2>Event Sponsorship Program</h2>
        <p>In 2014, Rackspace developers and developer advocates attended, sponsored, spoke at, and facilitated hundreds of conferences, meetups, and workshops for developers and technologists around the world. This "fanatical support" in the field is central to Rackspace's mission: we want to meet developers where they are, in their communities, and show them the love and support they need to build amazing things on the Rackspace Cloud Platform.

        <h2>OSS Hosting Program</h2>
        <p>Since 2013, Rackspace has provided generous discounts on hosting for more than 150 OSS projects and communities. We support a wide range of projects from the security, scientific computing, big data, open hardware, and Python communities, among others.
